  <!-- Purpose of the website -->
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p> Growing up I've seen lots of Maori and Pasifika families struggle with
      finances. Maori and Pasifika people are more vulnerable to financial
      issues and this is largely due to the lack of resources, discussions and
      guidance around topics like managing debt, having multiple streams of
      outcome, investing etc.</p>

    <p>So I created this space to educate and provide resources for our Maori
      and Pasifika youth so that we can thrive and not let money dictate
      our lives but rather give us options in life. This educational resource has been created to help Māori
      and Pasifika students learn about financial literacy. The aim is to
      educate and empower Māori and Pasifika youth to embark on their journey
      towards financial literacy. </p>

    <p>
      Designed by our people, for our people. As I continue to develop this
      website I strive to incorporate as much flexibility as possible because I
      understand not everyone has the same learning needs and this should not
      be a barrier.</p>
