    <h2>Budgeting Basics</h2>
    <p>Although it may seem basic, budgeting plays an important part in sorting
    out our finances.</p>

    <p>First of all you may be asking "What is a budget?" A budget is a statement
    that records your planned expenditure and your expected income over a certain
    period of time. This basically means how much you think you'll spend and how
    much you think you'll earn over a period of time usually a month.</p>

    <p>Income is anything coming into your account like gifts, lunch money, wages or
    even dividends (which is a word used for income earned on shares).</p>

    <p>Expenses is anything going out of your account like
    car repairs, rent, food, transport etc.</p>

    <p>For most households the top 3 areas of spending are shelter, food and
    transport so cautious planning in our budgets in this area will help save so
    much money which can be dedicated to other areas of spending.</p>
