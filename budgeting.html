  <h2>Budgeting</h2>
  <p>Although it may seem basic, budgeting plays an important part in sorting
  out our finances.
  <br>
  <br>

  First of all you may be asking "What is a budget?" A budget is a statement
  that records your planned expenditure and your expected income over a certain
  period of time. This basically means how much you think you'll spend and how
  much you think you'll earn over a period of time usually a month.
  <br>
  <br>

  Income is anything coming into your account like gifts, lunch money, wages or
  even dividends (which is a word used for income earned on shares).
  <br>
  <br>

  Expenses is anything going out of your account like
  car repairs, rent, food, transport etc.
  <br>
  <br>

  For most households the top 3 areas of spending are shelter, food and
  transport so cautious planning in our budgets in this area will help save so
  much money which can be dedicated to other areas of spending.
