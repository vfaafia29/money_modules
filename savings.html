    <h2>Expect the Unexpected: Fa'alavelave</h2>
    <p>An example of a major financial issue in Samoan communities is managing
    fa’alavelave which can be funerals, weddings, birthdays etc where there is
    a financial obligation to give money. Similar variations also exist in other
    Pasifika and Māori communities.</p>

    <p>Family and giving are extremely valued in Samoan culture therefore
    it’s in or nature to want to give back and help out our families/communities
    in the form of money donations. This beautiful part of our culture can
    quickly become out of hand when families prioritise this over putting food
    on the table for their own households.</p>

    <p>Fa’alavelave like funerals often come up unexpectedly so families
    have to find a way to come up with quick cash. This usually means cutting
    out household spending or borrowing a loan which can quickly become a heavy
    financial burden especially with loan sharks.</p>

    <p>This poses the question how do we develop a money mindset and/or money
    habits that allow us to contribute to family/cultural practices but not at
    the expense of our own financial well-being? We can’t control when a
    fa’alavelave will happen however we can attempt to prepare by putting money
    aside for a rainy day and demonstrates the importance of having an emergency
    fund for when unexpected events like a fa'alavelave come up.</p>

    <p>For some families this may not be possible as they
    trying to live from pay day to pay day therefore finding a balance is
    extremely important even if this means contributing later or in a different
    way. The most effective ways of dealing with fa’alavelave is through being
    proactive instead of reactive because it can have many negative
    flow-on effects.</p>
