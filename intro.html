  <h2>Introduction to Financial Literacy: Money Mindsets</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Financial literacy. Although this may sound big and scary, do not stress
    Money Modules is here to break down these confusing concepts</p>

    <p>First of all lets discuss money mindsets. Our money mindset is our values
    and beliefs that influence how we choose to manage our money.</p>

    <p>Understanding our money mindsets will help us to identify what really
    matters to us and our potential weaknesses where we could develop better
    money habits. Financial indepence will be the end goal for most of us, where
    money give us options in life. For example the option to buy our own home,
    the option to invest in our education, the option to help out our families
    while still being able to provide for our own etc.</p>

    <p>It's important to remeber that financial indpendence is a long term
    journey. So when setting our financial goals the aim isn't to get rid of
    all the stuff we enjoy. For example we may value going out with friends, in
    the long term getting rid of this isn't very sustainable instead we may try
    to limit outings to once a week instead of 3-4 times a week</p>
